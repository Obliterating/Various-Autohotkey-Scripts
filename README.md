# My various autohotkey scripts
On 2/24/2024, I decided to add more of my scripts here as recommended by a kind lady.
I self-taught myself Autohotkey in the 8th grade during virtual school.

I would recommend checking out the following scripts:
- boldandhighlight.ahk was useful for virtual school as it saved me time pressing the "bold" and "highlight" keys
- importpymodules.ahk was useful for me to use Python's IDLE to do math. I could quickly open up IDLE and run the script, which would allow me to then do math easily.
- My various autoclicker scripts, which I only used for games which allowed them. This includes my attempt at a "megascript" which would use a GUI to allow for me to use multiple types of autoclicking scripts at once. "Enderman XP Autoclicker" was wrote to solve a custom problem in Minecraft, automating an otherwise tedious process.

Some of these scripts are unfinished, but I decided to upload them here anyways to demonstrate my continuous use of Autohotkey as practice.
